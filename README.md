# Genetic-Algorithms

• Nature Has always been a great source of inspiration to all mankind. 
Genetic Algorithms (GA’s) are search based algorithms based on the 
concepts of natural selection and genetics. GA’s are a subset of a 
much larger branch of computation known as Evolutionary
Computation. 
• Genetic Algorithms are sufficiently randomized in nature, but they 
perform much better than random local search, as they exploit 
historical information as well.
• In GA’s, we have a pool or population of possible solutions to the 
given problem. These solutions then undergo recombination and 
mutation, producing new children, and the process is repeated over 
various generations.
• Each individual is assigned a fitness value and the fitter individuals 
are given a higher chance to mate and yield more “fitter” individuals. 
• In this way we keep “evolving” better individuals or solution over 
generations, till we reach a stopping criterion.
